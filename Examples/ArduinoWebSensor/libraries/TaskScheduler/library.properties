sentence=A light-weight cooperative multitasking library for arduino microcontrollers.
paragraph=Enables developers to achieve pseudo multi-tasking. The library is NOT pre-emptive, and as such requires cooperative programming to be used; does NOT use any of the timers therefore does not affect PWM pins. Includes support for status request objects, allowing tasks to wait on and signal event completion between each other.
