## SI-GAC Project 2015

_**S**istema **I**ntegrado de **G**erenciamento de **A**cidentes e **C**rises_

(Accident and Crisis Management Integrated System)

----

The SI-GAC project aims to create a fully integrated software system to manage cooperation between different forces during accidents and crises. Being a system that requires extremely high reliability, the SCADE Suite was chosen as the main technology to power the project.

The project is in active development by an interdisciplinary team of about 80 graduate and undergraduate students from _Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica_ (Aeronautics Institute of Technology) in Brazil, led by professors Dsc. Adilson Marques da Cunha and PhD. Luis Alberto Vieira Dias.
